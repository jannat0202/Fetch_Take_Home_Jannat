# Fetch_Take_Home_Jannat


I have created the Relational Diagram is such a way that the grain of the Fact Table is each receipt uploaded by a user.
There are 4 tables here
1. BRANDS - The brand ID is the primary key here
2. RECEIPTS - The receipt ID is the primary key here
3. RECEIPT_ITEMS - The REWARDS_RECEIPT_ITEM_ID is the primary key here
4. USERS - The ID of a user is the primary key here


Some insights noticed during the entire process are as follows:

1. Men are the lowest users of the fetch application.

2. Apple is the highest sign up source amongst users.

3. Walmart has the maximum number of receipts that were scanned by users.

4. Finally, as the dataset contained a lot of missing values, I believe a lot of insights might not lead to the best results.
