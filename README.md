I have created the Relational Diagram is such a way that the grain of the Fact Table is each receipt uploaded by a user.
There are 4 tables here
1. BRANDS - The brand ID is the primary key here
2. RECEIPTS - The receipt ID is the primary key here
3. RECEIPT_ITEMS - The REWARDS_RECEIPT_ITEM_ID is the primary key here
4. USERS - The ID of a user is the primary key here


Men are the lowest users
Apple is the highest sign up source
